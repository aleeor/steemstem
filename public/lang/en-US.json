"COMMON_ABOUT_US":"<div class='ui label teal fluid'><h1>Our Mission</h1></div><p><h3>Improving how STEM disciplines are communicated across the web, one blog post at a time.</h3></p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>About SteemSTEM</h1></div><br /><div class='text-justify'>SteemSTEM began as a small project dedicated to improving the quality of STEM (science, technology, engineering & mathematics) content on the <a href='https://www.steem.io'><strong>Steem blockchain</strong></a>. However, as things unfolded, we realized that the importance of SteemSTEM is greater than simply serving as curators for some niche topics on Steem.<br /><br />The problem as we see it has always been that those with the greatest knowledge of STEM subjects (<i>i.e.</i> researchers actively involved in groundbreaking research) lack incentive to communicate their work to mainstream audiences, leaving the majority of scientific reporting to journalists. As a result, only the most positive, groundbreaking and bizarre stories get heard, often becoming misinterpreted ‘fake news’ by mainstream media. <br /><br />We at SteemSTEM offer a different approach. We provide a space among a thriving global community of like-minded individuals where both experts and passionate STEM bloggers can freely distribute their knowledge in a social media environment that actively promotes and rewards honest, reliable and high-quality content. Inspired by the scientific method itself, SteemSTEM offers a three-layered system of review for each publication we promote: <ul style='list-style-type:circle'><li style='margin-bottom:10px'><strong>Curators</strong> first read, review and decide on the strength of the SteemSTEM support to the publication. This is verified by a second curator.</li> <li style='margin-bottom:10px'>A team of <strong>honor members</strong> scrutinizes the actions of curators, having rewards removed among other necessary actions.</li><li>Every promotion is open to the <strong>public</strong> who can further scrutinize and push for any necessary actions against misleading or fraudulent content that managed to pass through. This process means that SteemSTEM is one of the greatest spaces on the blockchain to find trustworthy, uncensored information that is both readable and enjoyable to be a part of.</li></ul>SteemSTEM offers content in <strong>7 languages</strong>: Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Slavic and Spanish.</div><br /><br /><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>The SteemSTEM Team</h1></div><br /><br /><div class='ui three cards'><div class='ui card'><div class='image'><img src='./images/team/rbauer.jpg'></div><div class='content'><a class='header'>Robert Bauer</a><div class='description'><a href ='@justtryme90'>Blog on steemstem.io</a></div></div><div style='margin:10px' class='text-justify'>Robert is a PhD biochemist and pharmaceutical research scientist with over 10 years research experience focused on the kinetic characterization of DNA replication enzyme complexes and rare genetic diseases.

  "COMMON_FAQ":"<div class='ui label teal fluid'><h1>Frequently asked questions</h1></div><p></p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>SteemSTEM in a nutshell</h1></div><br /><div class='text-justify'><p>SteemSTEM initially aimed at improving the quality of STEM (science, technology, engineering & mathematics) content on the <a href='https://www.steem.io'><strong>Steem blockchain</strong></a>. As the project developed, our objectives have been redesigned more ambitiously. SteemSTEM now intends to <b>increase the usage of the Steem blockchain for science communication</b>, developing an innovative way for those with the greatest knowledge of STEM subjects (<i>i.e.</i> researchers actively involved in groundbreaking research) to communicate about their work to mainstream audiences (and potentially earn monetary compensation in the form of the Steem cryptocurrency) without having to leave the majority of scientific reporting to journalists. In this way, the SteemSTEM platform can provide a solution to the problem where only the most positive, groundbreaking and bizarre stories get heard and are often misinterpreted.</p><p>In other words, we are working to <b>create an environment where STEM professionals and enthusiasts alike are incentivised to elevate STEM communication to a new level</b>, directly to the readers without the need of a third party. </p> <p>The SteemSTEM community consists today of scientists and STEM experts, science bloggers, curators, collaborators and more, from all over the world. We all share ideas, work together or simply hang out in our <b><a href='https://discord.gg/mKSKQ7T'>discord server</a></b>. We also share our actions (through announcements on the <b><a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@steemstem'>@steemstem blog</a></b> on Steem), where anyone can, if motivated, play an important part in contributing by raising his/her voice.<br /></p></div><p></p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>Being a member of the SteemSTEM community</h1></div><br /><div class='text-justify'><p>Though no 'membership' is required, by being part of our growing initiative, you get to both enjoy a community of like-minded individuals as well as contribute your own value in return via posts, discussions, comments and other forms of engagement.<br /></p></div><p></p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>How do I get supported?</h1></div><br /><div class='text-justify'><p>Posts are supported according to <b>objective and subjective criteria</b>.</p><p> Our objective requirements ensure that a post is <b>related to STEM</b> (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) content, although we do allow for some flexibility in what we consider as STEM. For example, history, psychology, economics, medicine and more are supported. Moreover, we verify that <b>a post is not fraudulent or dishonest</b>. This includes a check of the references and image credits (that must also be available for commercial purposes), as well as a plagiarism verification. A supported post must indeed be one’s own work. Furthermore, there is <b>no length requirement</b>. Finally, we work on the foundations of social media so that content creators are encouraged to utilize enthusiasm, humour, natural tone and simplified language to best reach larger audiences. We also stress that SteemSTEM accepts content in <b>multiple languages</b> (Chinese, English, French, German, Italian, Slavic and Spanish).</p><p>Our subjective criteria assess the <b>post quality</b> (including originality, style, effort, creativity, <i>etc.</i>) and correspondingly the strength of the SteemSTEM support.</p><ul><li><b>5%:</b> This voting strength is used either to encourage a new user or to acknowledge effort.</li><li><b>20%:</b> An average vote for an average post that does not report anything new or exciting, or that is not written with any personality or passion.</li><li><b>65%: </b> These are very good posts that show both character in their writing style as well as bring unique or fascinating content to the blockchain, and users attention. We feel content of this calibur contains information that users might search for in the future, or it may be simply apparent that a lot of efforts went into creating the post.</li><li><b>100%: </b> This is the best of the best, often written by trusted and long-term loyal members of the community who have a history of flare and unique approaches to their subject. This content may be completely original, even groundbreaking, demonstrating one's own research, and it will typically be an easy and even fun read. We expect this content to play role in bringing users into our community purely on its impressive nature alone!</li></ul><p>We emphasize that we look for <b>content that is easily digestible to non STEM degree holding readers</b>. We do not discount particularly technical work but one needs to consider why we publish on a social media blockchain, and how we can best utilise it for mainstream adoption. We moreover <b>discourage posts that are simple rewordings of other articles</b> such as those on Wikipedia.</p><p> If the post is above our minimum support, it must be double-checked by a second curator who may further verify the above details before confirming the upvote. Moreover, our <b>honor members</b> are also on the case, making sure the curation team is not being lax in their job, finding problems missed and more. </p> <p> If an illegitimate author manages to pass through this screening, the public can also view our curation history and highlight any mistakes we may have made, which, if sufficient evidence is provided, will cause rewards to be removed and for that author to be blacklisted from future curation. </p></div><p></p>  <div class='ui label fluid'><h1>The #steemstem tag and the steemstem.io app</h1></div><br /><div class='text-justify'><p>The SteemSTEM curators primarily scour the <b>'#steemstem' tag</b> to find the best STEM content posted on the Steem blockchain. Whilst we also browse other STEM tags (like '#science,' '#biology,' '#chemistry', '#engineering', <i>etc.</i>) to discover new content creators, the non-mandatory usage of the #steemstem tag makes our life easier and increases the chances for your post to be found. As there is no post promotion channel on the <b><a href='https://discord.gg/mKSKQ7T'>SteemSTEM discord server</a></b>, including the #steemstem tag is important for a post to be noticed by the team, especially for new users.</p><p>If you have not been selected for SteemSTEM support, your post either fails to meet our standards or it has simply been missed. Curators are (unfortunately) all human, so that this happens from time to time. We suggest you just keep writing, for passion and not for money. If your posts are good, you will eventually be noticed.</p> <p><b>Articles posted from the <a href='https://www.steemstem.io'>steemstem.io app</a> get more strongly supported</b>, as well as <b>posts sharing a fraction of their rewards with the <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@steemstem'>@steemstem account</a></b> (to be set as a beneficiary). In total, both these criteria can bring up to 10% stronger vote support.<br /></p></div><p></p> <div class='ui label fluid'><h1>The SteemSTEM team</h1></div><br /><div class='text-justify'><p> <u>Management</u>: <b><a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@justtryme90'>@justtryme90</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@lemouth'>@lemouth</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@mobbs'>@mobbs</a></b></p><p> <u>PR team</u>: <b><a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@katerinaramm'>@katerinaramm</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@kingabesh'>@kingabesh</a></b></p><p><u>Curators</u>: <b><a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@aboutcoolscience'>@aboutcoolscience</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@alexs1320'>@alexs1320</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@carloserp-2000'>@carloserp-2000</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@chappertron'>@chappertron</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@cryptoitaly'>@cryptoitaly</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@gentleshaid'>@gentleshaid</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@greenrun'>@greenrun</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@iamphysical'>@iamphysical</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@lamouthe'>@lamouthe</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@mathowl'>@mathowl</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@robertyan'>@robertyan</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@sco'>@sco</a>, <a href='https://www.steemstem.io/#!/@softmetal'>@softmetal</a></b></p></div>"
